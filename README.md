# Debt Statistics
This repository contains code for the World Bank's Debt Statistics.

## Background
Debt statistics are produced as part of the World Bank's own work to monitor the creditworthiness of its clients and are widely used by others for analytical and operational purposes. Recurrent debt crises, including the global financial crisis of 2008, highlight the importance of measuring and monitoring external debt stocks and flows, and managing them sustainably.


Every year, the World Bank releases the International Debt Statistics (IDS) publication which presents statistics and analysis on the external debt and financial flows (debt and equity) for low- and middle-income economies. Every quarter, the World Bank supplements this publication with additional information on the public sector and high-income countries. You can find more information about the World Bank's Debt Statistics on the [Debt Portal](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/debt/).

### 1. [api-guide: Connecting to the IDS database using APIs in Python and R](https://github.com/worldbank/debt-data/tree/master/api-guide)

To encourage the exploration and analysis of the World Bank's International Debt Statistics data, we published a step-by-step guide on how to access debt data using the World Bank Data API and do some exploratory analysis. This will be a two part series. The first guide will show how to query the API for your indicator and location of choice. The second guide will show how to call that information and create a basic chart.
