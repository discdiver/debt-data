Connecting to the IDS database using APIs in Python and R. To encourage the exploration and analysis of the World Bank's Debt Statistics data, we are working on a step-by-step guide on how to access debt data using the World Bank Data API and then do some exploratory analysis. This will be a two part series. The first guide will show how to query the API for your indicator and location of choice. The second guide will show how to call that information and create a basic chart.
