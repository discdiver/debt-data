## Accessing International Debt Statistics (IDS) through the World Bank Data API

Use the step-by-step guides below to learn how to access the International Debt Statistics (IDS) database using the World Bank Data API.
The two-part guides are available in both Python and R. You will learn how to query the World Bank Data API to retrieve the
available database topics (such as External Debt, Education, Trade, etc.), the corresponding indicators, and available countries, regions,
or income level categories. Using those parameters, along with years, you will create a data series and an interactive chart.

For readability and ease of access, the links below take you to the GitHub Page for each guide.
